The system parses the request and builds the workflow plan. |\\n| **Conversational Clarification** | If the request is ambiguous, the system asks follow\u2011up questions to narrow down the exact intent (e.g., \u201cWhich market are you interested in?\u201d). |\\n| **Message History** | A chat\u2011style list that shows your messages, system clarification questions, and final AI responses, each visually distinguished for easy reading. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. **Orbimesh Frontend \u2013 User\u2019s Guide (overall product overview)**  \\n\\n#### 5.1 Main Interface Overview  \\nThe UI is divided into two zones:  \\n\\n1. **App Sidebar (Navigation)** \u2013 persistent menu on the left.  \\n2. **Main Content Area** \u2013 where the Orchestrator, Agent Directory, etc., live.  \\n\\n#### 5.2 App Sidebar Details  \\n\\n- **Orbimesh Logo** \u2013 click to return to the main Orchestrator page.  \\n- **Orchestrator** \u2013 central page for creating/executing multi\u2011agent workflows.  \\n- **Agent Directory** \u2013 marketplace for browsing, searching, and testing available AI agents.  \\n- **Metrics & Dashboard** \u2013 future feature for analytics on usage.  \\n- **Profile / Settings** \u2013 future feature for account management.  \\n- **Register Agent** \u2013 button for adding your own custom AI agent to the platform.  \\n\\nThe sidebar collapses on desktop to free screen space and auto\u2011hides on mobile devices.  \\n\\n#### 5.3 The Orchestrator (Command Center)  \\n\\n- **Layout:** Split view \u2013 left side = Interactive Chat Interface; right side = Orchestration Details Sidebar.  \\n- **Function:** You describe a complex goal in plain English; the platform translates it into a multi\u2011step workflow that is executed by the selected agents, while you watch progress in the sidebar.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. **TL;DR \u2013 How it all fits together**  \\n\\n1. **You type a request** in the **Interactive Chat Interface**.  \\n2. The system may ask **clarifying questions**, then builds a **plan** (list of tasks) and a **visual workflow graph** shown in the **Plan Tab**.  \\n3. All the details (estimated cost/time, agents involved, task list, progress icons) appear in the **Orchestration Details Sidebar** under the **Metadata**, **Plan**, and (future) **Attachments** tabs.  \\n4. As the workflow runs, each **Task Node** updates its status icon (pending \u2192 completed).  \\n5. When finished, any generated files are accessible via the **Attachments Tab**, and you can **rate the agents** for future improvements.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. **Image Included in the Document**  \\n\\nThe document also contains an illustration of a **snow\u2011capped mountain** against a blue sky with scattered clouds.
