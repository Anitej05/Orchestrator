The GUI must display a 3x3 grid where each cell is clickable; when the user clicks a cell, an X is placed. After the user's move, the program should automatically make a computer move (O) using a simple strategy (random valid move or basic rule). The game must enforce all Tic‑Tac‑Toe rules, detect win and draw conditions after each move, and display an appropriate message (e.g., \"You win!\", \"Computer wins\", \"Draw\"). Include a clearly labeled button to restart the game without restarting the program. Ensure the interface updates in real time, handles invalid clicks (e.g., clicking an occupied cell), and runs without errors."
