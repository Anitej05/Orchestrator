A quick lookup of reputable statistical aggregators (Worldometer and Statista) gave the exact 2019 nominal GDP of **$2.835 trillion**, and both sources agree on this number.\n\n### Quick interpretation\n- **Growth trend:** After a **5.7 % contraction in 2020** (caused largely by the COVID‑19 pandemic), India’s economy rebounded strongly, posting an **18.4 % increase in 2021** and continued expansion through 2022‑2023.  \n- **Scale:** By **2023**, India’s nominal GDP reached **$3.568 trillion**, making it one of the world’s top 5 economies by nominal size.\n\n---\n\n**What else can I help you with?**  \n- Convert these figures into Indian rupees, PPP‑adjusted terms, or other units.  \n- Provide a visual chart of the GDP trend.  \n- Offer deeper analysis (e.g., sector‑wise contributions, per‑capita GDP).  \n\nJust let me know your next need!",
