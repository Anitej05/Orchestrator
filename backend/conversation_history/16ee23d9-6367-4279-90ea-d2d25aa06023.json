The larger percentage rise in INR reflects both real economic growth and the depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar over the same period.\n\nThese figures represent the most recent publicly‑available nominal GDP numbers for the five calendar years you requested.  \n\n**If you need additional details—such as real (inflation‑adjusted) GDP, GDP per‑capita, or quarterly breakdowns—just let me know and I’ll retrieve them for you.**",
