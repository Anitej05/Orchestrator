        "content": "**Final Report – Workflow Execution Attempt**\n\n**Requested workflow:**  \n> “Please analyze and execute the requested workflow.”\n\n**Task that was run:**  \n- **Perform web search and summarize** – intended to gather information from the web and provide a concise summary.\n\n**Outcome:**  \n- The web‑search step could not be completed. The AI agent reported a network error: **“All connection attempts failed.”**  \n- Consequently, no data could be retrieved, and no summary could be generated.\n\n---\n\n### What This Means\n- The core of the requested workflow (searching the web for information) did not succeed, so there is currently no material to analyze or summarize.\n- No other tasks were defined or executed, so the overall workflow remains incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n| Option | Description | How to Proceed |\n|--------|-------------|----------------|\n| **1. Retry the web search** | Attempt the same search again; sometimes transient network issues resolve on a second try. | I can re‑run the “perform web search and summarize” task now. |\n| **2. Provide alternative sources** | If the web search is unavailable, we could use pre‑existing knowledge (up to my 2024‑06 cutoff) to address the topic. | Let me know the specific subject you need information on, and I’ll generate a summary from my internal knowledge base. |\n| **3. Refine the request** | Clarify or narrow the scope (e.g., specific keywords, a particular website, or a different type of data) to improve the chances of a successful search. | Provide any additional details or constraints you’d like me to apply. |\n| **4. Cancel or modify the workflow** | If the web search is no longer needed, we can shift to a different task (e.g., data analysis on supplied documents, brainstorming ideas, etc.). | Tell me the new direction you’d like to take. |\n\n---\n\n### Immediate Action (if you choose to proceed)\n\n- **If you want me to retry now:** simply reply “Please retry the web search.”\n- **If you prefer using internal knowledge:** specify the topic (e.g., “Summarize the latest trends in renewable energy”), and I’ll produce a summary without external web access.\n- **If you have additional instructions or constraints:** let me know, and I’ll adjust the workflow accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The intended web‑search step failed due to a network issue, so the workflow could not be completed. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed—whether to retry the search, use internal knowledge, refine the request, or shift to a different task. I’m ready to continue as soon as you provide guidance.",
