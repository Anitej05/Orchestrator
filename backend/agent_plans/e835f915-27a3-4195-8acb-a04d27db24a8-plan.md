        "answer": "**India \u2013 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the Past Five Calendar Years (2023\u20112019)**  \n\n| Year | GDP (current US\u202f$) | Source |\n|------|-------------------|--------|\n| **2023** | **$3.568\u202ftrillion** | Macrotrends \u2013 \u201cIndia GDP for 2023 was 3.568 trillion US dollars, a 6.38\u202f% increase from 2022.\u201d |\n| **2022** | **$3.353\u202ftrillion** | Macrotrends \u2013 \u201cIndia GDP for 2022 was 3.353 trillion US dollars, a 5.88\u202f% increase from 2021.\u201d |\n| **2021** | **$3.167\u202ftrillion** | Macrotrends \u2013 \u201cIndia GDP for 2021 was 3.167 trillion US dollars, a 18.41\u202f% increase from 2020.\u201d |\n| **2020** | **$2.675\u202ftrillion** | Macrotrends \u2013 \u201cIndia GDP for 2020 was 2.675 trillion US dollars, a 5.67\u202f% decline from 2019.\u201d |\n| **2019** | **$2.835\u202ftrillion** | Worldometer (and corroborated by Statista) \u2013 \u201cIndia GDP for 2019 was $2,835.61\u202fbillion.\u201d |\n\n### How the numbers were obtained\n1. **Primary source for 2020\u20112023:** The Macrotrends page *\u201cIndia GDP \u2013 Historical Chart & Data\u201d* lists the nominal GDP values for each year in current U.S. dollars, together with the year\u2011over\u2011year percentage change.  \n2. **2019 figure:** Macrotrends only gave the change for 2020 (a decline from 2019) but did not list the 2019 absolute value. A quick search of reputable statistical aggregators (Worldometer and Statista) provided the exact 2019 nominal GDP: **$2.835\u202ftrillion**. Both sources present the same figure, confirming its reliability.  \n\n### Quick interpretation\n- **Growth trend:** After a contraction in 2020 (\u20115.67\u202f% due to the COVID\u201119 pandemic), India\u2019s economy rebounded strongly, posting double\u2011digit growth in 2021 (\u201118.41\u202f% increase) and continued expansion through 2023.  \n- **Scale:** By 2023, India\u2019s nominal GDP reached **$3.568\u202ftrillion**, placing it among the world\u2019s top\u20115 economies by nominal size.  \n\nFeel free to let me know if you need the data expressed in other units (e.g., Indian rupees, PPP\u2011adjusted terms) or if you\u2019d like a visual chart of the trend.",
