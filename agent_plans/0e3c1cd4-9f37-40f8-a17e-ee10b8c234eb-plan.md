        "answer": "Below is a walk\u2011through of the different parts of the document you supplied. For each heading I explain **what the section is for** and **what it contains**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Tasks (simple list of workflow steps)  \n**Purpose:**\u202fShows the granular actions the orchestrator has broken your request into.  \n**Content:**\u202fA plain\u2011text list of the individual tasks that will be handed off to the various AI agents.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Plan Tab (visual workflow overview)  \n**Purpose:**\u202fGives you a quick, visual snapshot of the whole workflow.  \n\n### 2.1 Execution Plan Graph  \n* **What it is:**\u202fA flow\u2011chart\u2011style diagram that connects the different tasks in the order they will be executed.  \n* **Key elements:**  \n  * **Start Node** \u2013 the entry point of the workflow.  \n  * **Task Nodes** \u2013 each subsequent box represents one of the tasks listed in the \u201cTasks\u201d section.  \n  * **Status Icons** \u2013 visual cues for progress: a green check\u2011mark when a node is finished, a yellow clock when it\u2019s still pending.  \n\n### 2.2 Attachments Tab (placeholder)  \n**Purpose:**\u202fReserved for future use. When the workflow creates files (reports, screenshots, data dumps, etc.) they will appear here for you to download.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Orchestration Details Sidebar (real\u2011time workflow monitor)  \nWhen a request is understood and a plan is created, a right\u2011hand panel slides out. It stays visible while the workflow runs and is split into three tabs.\n\n### 3.1 Metadata Tab (high\u2011level summary & controls)  \n\n| Sub\u2011section | What it does | What you\u2019ll see |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Execution Summary** | Shows the estimated cost and total time for the whole workflow. | Numbers/estimates for price and duration. |\n| **Agents Used** | Lists every AI agent that will participate (or has participated) in the run. | A collapsible list with agent names, possibly short descriptions. |\n| **Rate Agents** | After the workflow finishes you can give each agent a star rating to help the platform improve future selections. | A rating widget for each agent. |\n| **Tasks** | Re\u2011states the simple list of individual steps (the same list you see in the \u201cTasks\u201d section). | A bullet\u2011point list of task names. |\n\n### 3.2 Plan Tab (same visual representation as the left\u2011hand \u201cPlan Tab\u201d)  \n**Purpose:**\u202fProvides the same flow\u2011chart view inside the sidebar, so you can monitor progress without leaving the panel.  \n\n### 3.3 Attachments Tab (same placeholder as the one described earlier)  \n**Purpose:**\u202fWhen the workflow finishes, any generated artifacts will be listed here for download.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Interactive Chat Interface (the entry point for users)  \n\n### 4.1 How you start a workflow  \n* **What you do:**\u202fType a natural\u2011language goal into the text box (e.g., \u201cFind the latest news about NVIDIA, summarize it, and get the current stock price\u201d).  \n* **Result:**\u202fThe system parses the request and generates the workflow plan described above.\n\n### 4.2 Conversational Clarification  \n* **Purpose:**\u202fIf the request is ambiguous, the system asks follow\u2011up questions to narrow down the exact intent (e.g., asking for a missing city name).  \n\n### 4.3 Message History  \n* **What you see:**\u202fA chat\u2011style list that shows your messages, the system\u2019s clarification questions, and the final AI response, each distinguished by color/alignment for easy reading.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Orbimesh Frontend: A User\u2019s Guide (overall product overview)  \n\n### 5.1 Main Interface Overview  \nDivides the UI into two big zones:\n\n1. **App Sidebar (Navigation)** \u2013 persistent menu on the left for moving between major sections.\n2. **Main Content Area** \u2013 where the actual interaction (Orchestrator, Agent Directory, etc.) happens.\n\n### 5.2 App Sidebar Details  \n* **Orbimesh Logo** \u2013 click to return to the main Orchestrator page.  \n* **Orchestrator** \u2013 the central page for creating/executing multi\u2011agent workflows.  \n* **Agent Directory** \u2013 marketplace for browsing, searching, and testing available AI agents.  \n* **Metrics & Dashboard** \u2013 future feature for analytics on your usage.  \n* **Profile / Settings** \u2013 future feature for managing your account.  \n* **Register Agent** \u2013 button for adding your own custom AI agent to the platform.  \n\nThe sidebar collapses on desktop to free up screen space and auto\u2011hides on mobile devices.\n\n### 5.3 The Orchestrator (Command Center)  \n* **Layout:**\u202fSplit view \u2013 left side = Interactive Chat Interface; right side = Orchestration Details Sidebar.  \n* **Function:**\u202fYou describe a complex goal in plain English; the platform translates it into a multi\u2011step workflow that is executed by the selected agents, while you watch progress in the sidebar.  \n\n---\n\n### TL;DR \u2013 How it all fits together  \n\n1. **You type a request** in the **Interactive Chat Interface**.  \n2. The system may ask **clarifying questions**, then builds a **plan** (list of tasks) and a **visual workflow graph** shown in the **Plan Tab**.  \n3. All the details (estimated cost/time, agents involved, task list, progress icons) appear in the **Orchestration Details Sidebar**, specifically under the **Metadata**, **Plan**, and (future) **Attachments** tabs.  \n4. As the workflow runs, each **Task Node** updates its status icon (pending \u2192 completed).  \n5. When finished, any generated files will be accessible via the **Attachments Tab**, and you can **rate the agents** for future improvements.  \n\nThat\u2019s the full breakdown of each section\u2019s purpose and the core content it contains."
